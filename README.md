📌 Overview

The Investment Portfolio Account Manager is a C#-based financial management system designed to track, analyze, and manage investment portfolios.

The application provides structured portfolio monitoring, asset allocation tracking, profit & loss calculation, and performance evaluation through a clean desktop interface.

It is designed to simulate real-world portfolio management logic used in brokerage and asset management systems.
